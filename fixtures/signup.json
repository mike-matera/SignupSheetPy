This includes medical, dehydration, or chemical issues, as well as any discord that may come up between campers. In addition, we can be counted on us to help protect the property and offer guidance about how to respect the grounds, the staff, and the rest of the FnF community. We are all here for the same reason…to have a good time. Karma Patrol aims to maintain the atmosphere of fun by minimizing the things that might get in the way. Karma Patrol is there to be friends and family. Especially if people are having a tough time.</p>\r\n<p><b>The details:</b> Each KP shift has a 2-person team who will walk around Saratoga Springs for 2 hours with backpacks containing items to help folks in need (basic first aid, water, electrolytes, basic convenience items), a radio to get additional assistance from Site Coordinators or Medical, and an unlimited supply of *consensual* hugs, handshakes, and smiley hellos. When reporting for your shift at the campout, please meet on the porch of the Heart Lodge near the \"Karma Patrol\" sign and wait for the previous team to arrive to receive hand-off from them. Don the super rad sparkly hot pink Karma Patrol vest and/or your KP t-shirt, the backpack, and your radio. Then hit the dirt to check on the party! At the end of your shift, you’ll return to the Heart Lodge where you’ll hand off to the oncoming shift and give them a short report on anything that may need follow up. There will be a journal to write notes so if anything significant happens, we can track it for resolution. There will be a map with the camping spots of the coordinator and those who are professionally trained to handle psychiatric issues. There will also be a list of sober campers who are available to support others who live substance-free lifestyles. Obviously, these helpful people won’t be available all the time, but please feel free to use them as resources if they're available. Remember, If things feel too big for you to deal with on your own, don’t hesitate to call a Site Coordinator or Medical. If ever additional assistance is needed from the KP coordinator, please notify the SC on-duty who can reach Cari Lee.\r\n<p>A mandatory orientation will happen at the campout on Friday at 5:30 PM and on Saturday at 11:00 AM.

At the end of your shift, you’ll return to the Heart Lodge where you’ll hand off to the oncoming shift and give them a short report on anything that may need follow up. There will be a journal to write notes so if anything significant happens, we can track it for resolution. There will be a map with the camping spots of the coordinator and those who are professionally trained to handle psychiatric issues. There will also be a list of sober campers who are available to support others who live substance-free lifestyles. Obviously, these helpful people won’t be available all the time, but please feel free to use them as resources if they're available.
